# Simple coin tossing example ---------------------------------------------
# _________________________________________________________________________

# choose number of tosses N
n.tosses <- 100

# simulate coin flips using sample() 
coin.tosses <- sample(x = c("Heads","Tails"), # possible outcomes
                      size = n.tosses, # number to choose
                      replace = T, # sample from x with replacement  
                      prob = c(1/2, 1/2)) # probability weights for the possible outcomes
table(coin.tosses)

# the likelihood function

likelihood <- function(p){ # argument is p, so for different values of p we get different likelihoods  
  n.heads <- sum(coin.tosses == "Heads") # number of heads observed
  
  dbinom(x = n.heads,     # binomial probability mass function for n.heads successes 
         size = n.tosses, # in n.tosses trials
         prob = p)        # as a function of the probability of success/heads, p
}


# note: instead of using the dbinom function we could also have typed out the binomial probability
#   mass function as: choose(n.tosses, n.heads) * p^n.heads * (1-p)^(n.tosses - n.heads)


# find the value of the likelihood function for some different values of p
likelihood(1/2) # likelihood for p = 1/2
likelihood(1/3) # likelihood for p = 1/3

# look at distribution of the likelihood function for p given our coin.tosses data
curve(likelihood, col = "turquoise4", lwd = 2, bty="l")

# we know that the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) in this simple example is just the observed
#   proportion of heads, but in general we can have R maximize a likelihood function using optimize() 
optimize(likelihood, # function to optimize
         interval = c(0,1), # interval to be searched
         maximum = T) # compute max instead of min

# the output from the optimize function has two components:
#   "maximum" is the value of p that maximizes the likelihood function
#   "objective" is the value of the likelihood function at the maximum
#   we can extract just "maximum" using the $ operator
max <- optimize(likelihood, interval = c(0,1), maximum = T)$maximum 

# show the maximum likelihood estimate and the true probability on our plotted likelihood curve

# Extending the coin tossing example --------------------------------------
# _________________________________________________________________________

# In the coin toss example above we set it so that the coin was fair. But we can also set it so
# that we don't know what the probability of heads is in advance. We can pick the probability
# at random and then see what the maximum likelihood estimate is

# set probability of heads 
p_heads <- runif(1) # runif(1) will pick 1 number uniformly at random between 0 and 1
# get a new set of coin tosses
coin.tosses <- sample(x = c("Heads","Tails"), 
                      size = n.tosses, 
                      replace = T, 
                      prob = c(p_heads, 1 - p_heads)) # use the randomly chosen p_heads
table(coin.tosses)
# take a look at the new likelihood function
curve(likelihood, col = "turquoise4", lwd = 2, bty="l")
# get the MLE
max <- optimize(likelihood, interval = c(0,1), maximum = T)$maximum 
# show the MLE and the true probability on our plotted likelihood curve

  # use the log-likelihood function (the natural logarithm of the likelihood) 
  #   using the log reduces the potentital for underflow/overflow when the computer tries to calculate
  #   the value that maximize the log-likelihood is the same value that maximizes the likelihood so the
  #   estimate is the same (i.e. argmax{log-likelihood} = argmax{likelihood})
